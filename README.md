# AWS-Quick-sight
Data analysis of spotify data using AWS services like S3, GlueETL, Athena and Quicksight

Step 1: Upload Data to S3 Bucket
Log in to AWS Console:

Navigate to the AWS Management Console and log in with your credentials.
Create an S3 Bucket:

Go to the S3 service.
Click "Create bucket."
Name your bucket (e.g., spotify-dataset-bucket), choose a region, and configure any desired settings.
Click "Create bucket."
Upload Dataset to S3:

Open your newly created bucket.
Click "Upload" and select the Spotify dataset files from your local machine.
Click "Upload" to transfer the files to your S3 bucket.
Step 2: Set Up AWS Glue for Data Cataloging
Navigate to AWS Glue:

Go to the AWS Glue service.
Create a Crawler:

In the AWS Glue console, click "Crawlers" and then "Add crawler."
Name your crawler (e.g., spotify-dataset-crawler).
For data store, select "S3" and specify the path to your S3 bucket.
Set up an IAM role that AWS Glue can use to access the data in S3.
Configure the crawler options and choose to create a new database (e.g., spotify_database).
Review and finish creating the crawler.
Run the Crawler:

Start the crawler to populate the AWS Glue Data Catalog with metadata about the Spotify dataset.
Step 3: Query Data Using AWS Athena
Navigate to AWS Athena:

Go to the Athena service.
Configure Athena:

In the Athena console, set up a query result location by clicking "Settings" and specifying an S3 bucket (e.g., s3://your-athena-query-results-bucket/).
Create a Database in Athena:

In the Athena query editor, run the following query to use the Glue database created by the crawler:
sql
Copy code
CREATE DATABASE spotify_database;
Query the Spotify Dataset:

Use SQL queries to analyze the Spotify dataset. For example, to select all data:
sql
Copy code
SELECT * FROM spotify_database.your_table_name LIMIT 10;
Perform joins, aggregations, and other SQL operations as needed.
Step 4: Visualize Data Using AWS QuickSight
Navigate to AWS QuickSight:

Go to the QuickSight service.
Create a New Dataset:

In QuickSight, click "Manage data" and then "New dataset."
Choose "Athena" as your data source.
Connect to the Athena database you created and select the table(s) from the Spotify dataset.
Prepare the Data:

Use QuickSightâ€™s data preparation tools to clean and transform the data if necessary.
Perform joins between different tables if required.
Build Visualizations:

Create various visualizations (e.g., charts, graphs) to represent the data insights.
Use different QuickSight features to customize and enhance your visuals.
Create a Dashboard:

Combine your visualizations into a comprehensive dashboard.
Share the dashboard with stakeholders as needed.
By following these steps, you can effectively analyze and visualize the Spotify dataset using AWS tools such as S3, Glue, Athena, and QuickSight.
